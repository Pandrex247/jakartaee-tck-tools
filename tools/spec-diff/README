This directory contains a tool that reports the differences between two
specification assertion documents.  The results are written to an XML
output file that enumerates the removed assertion IDs, the content
differences and IDs of modified assertions, and new assertions IDs.

This tool can be used to help CTS developers understand what has changed
from one version of their spec assertion document to the next version.

Basic tool hueristics.  The first spec assertion document specified (the 
prev-assertion-file property when run from ant) is considered to be the
original assertion document.  The tool first looks to ensure all the assertion
IDs in this document are also in the new spec document (the second spec
document specified or the new-assertion-file property when run from ant).
If the ID only appears in the first spec doc the ID is added to the list
of removed assertions.  Next the tool looks for assertions that exist in
both docs (using the IDs as the matching criteria) and determines if any
of the elements have different content.  If elements are found with
different content the tool adds these assertions to a list of modified
assertions.  Each modified assertion lists its ID and the names of the
lements that have been modified with the element's old value and new value.
Finally, the tool looks at each spec assertion ID in the new (2nd) document to
ensure the assertion IDs in that document are also in the first document.
If an ID only appears in the new document that ID is added to the list of
new assertions.
