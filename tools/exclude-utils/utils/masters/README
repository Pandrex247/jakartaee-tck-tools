Create a new file in this directory named like cts7_master_testlist.txt for version 7

To generate a master list
-------------------------
- Grab a released bundle and unzip it.
- set the harness.executeMode to 2 in ts.jte (if set to 5 same as list.tests)
- cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests
- ant runclient | grep "Beginning Test:" | cut -d " " -f 5 > master.list.file

Using list.tests target (faster option by quite a bit)
------------------------------------------------------
- Grab a released bundle and unzip it.
- cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests
- ant list.tests | grep "Finished Test:" | cut -d . -f 10-11 > master.list.file
