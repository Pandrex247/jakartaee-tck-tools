Overview
--------
This directory contains a very simple minded application that
replaces a specified tag (string) with a counter within a specified
input file.  For instance a user may have the following XML file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
  <ID>some title ID:_NUMBER_</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:_NUMBER_</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:_NUMBER_</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:_NUMBER_</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:_NUMBER_</ID>
</root>

The user would like to number each ID.  The tool can be used
to replace each occusrrence of the _NUMBER_ string with a counter.
The user must specify an input file to be numbered.  Optionally a
user can specify an output file to write the results to (if no
output file is specified the output file will be the input file with
a ".out" extension appended).  The user may also specify the initial
counter value (optional) to start the counter at as well as the
increment value (optional).  User may also supply the string value
that the application will replace with the counter value (optional).
Note: If two or more number replace tags are located on the same
line within the input file the same counter value will be used to
replace all occurrences.  Example output below:

command run: ant -Dinput_file=x.in run

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
  <ID>some title ID:1</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:2</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:3</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:4</ID>
  <ID>some title ID:5</ID>
</root>

This tool can be compiled and executed using the ant build file that
comes with the tool.  It can also be run from the command line using
the java interpretter.


Required Packages
-----------------
Users must install (or have installed) J2SE version 1.3 or higher and
Apache's Ant build tool, version 1.4.1 or higher.  J2SE 1.3 can be
downloaded from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/.  Apache's Ant can be
downloaded from http://jakarta.apache.org.  Follow the install
instructions included with each distribution.  Users do not have to
use Ant if they do not wish too, see the "Command Line Usage" section
for details of running without ant.


Command Line Usage
------------------
java -cp <path_to_classes> -input_file file [-output_file file]
     [-replace_tag tag] [-inc_num number] [-start_num number]


Supported Ant Targets
---------------------
  clean  : removes the build class files
  compile: (default target) builds the tool
  dist   : creates a set of distribution files under "dist" directory
  run    : runs the tool on the specified input file


Ant Usage
