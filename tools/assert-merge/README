Overview
--------
This directory contains a utility to merge Javadoc (API) assertion lists.
The utility takes two input files and produces a single output file.
The first input file is a verified assertion list.  This is a list
of Javadoc assertions that has been reviewed and verified to be
correct.  The second input file is a generated Javadoc assertion list.
This file is the result of running the assertion generation tool on
a technology area's source code.  The output of the tool is a file
that contains a merged assertion list.  This output file is then
reviewed and verified by hand.  All files conform to the
javadoc_assertion DTD located at:
http://invalid.domain.com/CTS/XMLassertions/dtd/javadoc_assertions.dtd

Currently, this tool only supports Javadoc (API) assertion lists.  There
is no support for specification assertions.  This is due to the fact that
specification assertions are generated by hand and will therefore not
benefit from an automated tool to merge hand editied documents.


Ant Targets
-----------
Current list of ant build targets:
compile (default): Builds the tool and any necessary components
clean            : Removes any built components
run              : Runs the merge tool, users must specify the two input
                   files and the resulting output file using relative or
                   absolute paths


Usage Statement
---------------
ant run -Dverfile=verified_file -Dnewfile=new_file -Doutfile=output_file
